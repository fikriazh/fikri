Hi and thanks for passing by, isn't it merely a coincidece?

Let's begin this all with one wandering question. Is the universe ruled by entity beyond our comprehension? Or it merely a system that works by itself without no chance at all to be controlled by something? If there are some ruler entities, so they are watching and observing us for this long earth time. I don't mean to mention to some alien entities outside there, because the alien is still in third dimension, which still has physical body. What I mean is, imagine we are life inside a huge space of simulation world (physical world, third dimension) and controlled or played or simulated by something outside there.

Hmm, It's too hard to think this things on the 'Hello World' page, right? But let's go ahead ...

I dare to think this deep concept because of for about this last 3 years, I'm going through such an abstract corridor, of course it's in third dimension, a corridor of spiritual journey but it doesn't like being able to see spooky things. It's beyond that cheapy ghostly concept. The journey is consist of mind-breaking phenomena and what I feel is like being guided.

I feel being in brain-washing corridor where I'm being guided slowly step by step, time by time, concept by concept, from one check point to another, one topic to another. And you know what? In just 3 years, my whole mind is totally changed, as I can borrow one term from hynotherapy called "subconscious". It is a long term memories, and to change it's value, it have to be changed slowly. The Subsconcsious will reject any changes in short and shock changes.

> The slow process will yield a whole new brain, totally change the old one, permanently.

The next question, where does the old memories go? Are they break apart, vanished to the unknown region of mind? I have hypothesis for such question. The way our mind write memories is in in write-only mode. It means that the memories is only hiding from your consciousness, your main current focus. The whole data is still there, but you choose not to touch that region and rather live with the new one.

> The forgotten meories is still there, in your life-hardisk, it can't be erased, it can only be forgotten from your current stage of consciousness.

Now, the phenomena is a bit different. The stage of change is over. Now, I'm on a stable state of consciousness, a stable foundation of sub-conscious.
