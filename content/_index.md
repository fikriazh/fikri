Hi, dear universe's fellow. Mahasemesta is a codename used to tell my spiritual stories, means the vastness of the universe. I used this as my son's name *Akasha Mahasemesta*, he is a symbol of my journey in finding the true nature of universe.

## Brief
I'm an Indonesian drilling fluid engineer, working remotely in harsh onshore oil-field industry, toil for oil. That's my formal life, kind of boring template money heist worker (even likely called energy warrior).

Meanwhile in the other side, I like to tell my spiritual stories, a journey in finding true meaning of this universe. Is there any rulers behind this all? I try not to believe, even think all of this is merely random abstract life, but why do I always got synchronized code 411?
