My name is Fikri Azhar Novianto and this is my personal website. I use it to share personal thoughts, document what I learned, plant some digital seeds, and host some unique content I want to share for particular reasons. Even so, I tend to write about my profession I try to keep the tone personal on this site.

I was born on Pangandaran (West Java - ID) on Wednesday, 30<sup>th</sup> November 1994 at 08.15 AM UTC+7. Short story, I continue studying bachelor degree in UPN Veteran Yogyakarta at Geological Engineering department. Now, I'm working as a drillinjg fluid engineer in oil & gas industry. Enough for the brief autobiography, the details can be find in blog post.

## Connect

If you wanna talk to me, please contact me through [ðŸ“ž WhatsApp](https://wa.me/6281226594717), my digital gallery on [ðŸ“· Instagram](https://instagram.com/fikzhry) or perhaps [ðŸ“§ Email](mailto:fikriazh@gmail.com). I also have [ðŸŽ¶ TikTok](https://tiktok.com/@mahasemesta) for publishing my vlog. Let's discuss about this universe, or maybe a little talking and a cup of tea.

## Website

Framework in this website uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with design from [Tobias Schmidt](http://tobiasschmidt.me/) (Thanks for permitting porting from Lume to Hugo) and edited some layout necessary (I love the purist, brutalist and minimalist style).

Data is stored on [Github](https://github.com/fikriazh/fikri) repo and connected to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) as hugo deployment and processing to static site and free sub-domain [fikri.pages.dev](/) from Cloudflare Pages as it's offer free HTTPS access. This site also connected to cloud CMS using [Forestry.io](https://forestry.io/).

My workflow in this site : Input writing on local cloned repo, edit my markdown content file with VS Code editor and push the commit directly to github. Another workflow is through smartphone with cloud forestry.io cloud CMS. I use this methode usually when in remote and unable to acces notebook. Forestry.io will monitor the changes and automatically push to github. I usually write and arrange the content on smartphone notes first then paste to forestry.io CMS.

If github repo detect any commit and push etiher from local cloned repo or from forestry.io, it will trigger deployment on Cloudflare Pages server and create static site to be served to fikri.pages.dev domain. This simplistic and automatic workflow makes me focus on content-making rather than thinking the tech bla bla bla behind the scene.

## Epilog

Thanks for so far reading until this end section, hope you get much of knowledge and information from my own perspective. Keep finding the truth, the system works behind this dimensional barrier. As we will keep evolving to *Homo Deus*, the human with 100% DNA function as our creator Enki Anunnaki imprint to us.
