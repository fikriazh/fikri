My name is Fikri Azhar Novianto and this is my personal website. I use it to share personal thoughts, document what I learned, plant some digital seeds, and host some unique content I want to share for particular reasons. Even so, I tend to write about my profession I try to keep the tone personal on this site.

I was born on Pangandaran (West Java - ID) on Wednesday, 30<sup>th</sup> November 1994 at 08.15 AM UTC+7. I grew up in a rural environment with limited acces for information (on year 2000 when internet is growing), far from book store and elementary school with very limited book collection. So, main input for brain is from television, I still remember how boring to change TV channel and nothing good enough to be watched except on sunday morning for cartoon show. When graduated from elementary school, I buy my first computer and install cable internet, that was milestone for me as that time I can open world windows, even on the village environment.

Short story, I continue studying bachelor degree in UPN Veteran Yogyakarta and I choose Geological Engineering department. Now, I'm working as a drillinjg fluid engineer in oil & gas industry. Enough for the brief autobiography, the details can be find in my blog.

## Connect

If any things need to be talked to me, please regardly reach me directly through ðŸ“ž [WhatsApp](https://wa.me/6281226594717), visit my digital gallery on ðŸ“· [Instagram](https://instagram.com/fikzhry) or perhaps through ðŸ“§ [Email](mailto:fikriazh@gmail.com). I also have ðŸŽ¶ [TikTok](https://tiktok.com/@mahasemesta) for publishing my short dailiy vlog. Let's discuss about this universe, or maybe just a little talking and a cup of cofee.

## Website

Framework in this website uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) SSG (Static Site Generator)  with design from [Tobias Schmidt](http://tobiasschmidt.me/) (Thanks for permitting me to port from Lume to Hugo) and edited some layout necessary, but the main design is still same (I love the purist, brutalist and minimalist style).

Deployment, hosting and all data is stored on [Github](https://github.com/fikriazh/fikri) and connected to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) as Hugo deployment and processing to Static Site. This site also connected to headless cloud CMS using [Forestry.io](https://forestry.io/).

Domain [fikri.pages.dev](/), free domain from Cloudflare Pages as it's offer free HTTPS access.

My workflow in this site : Input or writing on local cloned repo, edit my markdown content file with VS Code editor  and then push the commit directly to github. Another input workflow is through smartphone with cloud forestry.io cloud CMS. I use this methode usually when in remote area as I unable acces notebook, so I open the CMS through smartphone web browser. Forestry.io will monitor the changes and automatically push to github. I usually write and arrange the content on smartphone notes first then paste to forestry.io CMS.

If github repo detect any commit and push etiher from local cloned repo or from forestry.io, it will trigger deployment on Cloudflare Pages server and create static site to be served to fikri.pages.dev domain. This simplistic and automatic workflow makes me focus on content making rather than thinking the tech bla bla bla behind the scene.

## Epilog

Thanks for so far reading until this end section, hope you get much of knowledge and information from my own perspective. Keep finding the truth, the system works behind this dimensional barrier. As we will keep evolving to *Homo Deus*, the human with 100% DNA function as our creator Enki Anunnaki imprint to us.
