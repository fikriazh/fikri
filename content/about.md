My name is Fikri Azhar Novianto and this is my personal website Mahasemesta. So, you might guess what is Mahasemesta? This is my code name in this universe, kind of username-id in this universal server. It's common to differ display name and username, isn't it? I also use this codename as my son's name 'Akasha Mahasemesta'. Akasha means 'the central server of the universe', a place where all of the creature / entities memories is stored up. Mahasemesta itself is taken from Maha (huge, vastness) and Semesta (universe, whole world). I love to use this name in my daily uses. It is my expression of admiration to this complex yet neatly arranged universal things.

I use this minimal and simple blog to write everything I think about the universe, my personal perspective of life. I believe that each of us is a unique piece of the creator itself, one of billion uniqueness. I try to capture my unique life as a piece of the creator, to make a whole knowledge together with all other creature.

I was born on Pangandaran (West Java - ID) on Wednesday, 30<sup>th</sup> November 1994 at 08.15 AM UTC+7. Short story, I continue studying bachelor degree in UPN Veteran Yogyakarta at Geological Engineering department. Now, I'm working as a drilling fluid engineer in oil & gas industry. That's my shorten stories.

## Connect

If you wanna talk to me, please fetch me through [ðŸ“ž WhatsApp](https://wa.me/6281226594717), my digital gallery on [ðŸ“· Instagram](https://instagram.com/fikzhry) or perhaps [ðŸ“§ Email](mailto:fikriazh@gmail.com). I also have [ðŸŽ¶ TikTok](https://tiktok.com/@mahasemesta) for publishing my vlog. Let's discuss about this universe, or maybe a little talking with a cup of tea and beautiful sunset view.

## Website

Framework in this website uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with design from [Tobias Schmidt](http://tobiasschmidt.me/) (Thanks for permitting porting from Lume to Hugo) and edited some layout necessary (I love the purist, brutalist and minimalist style). I use Inter as main font, it is nice for reading purpose as my blog style is extremely text based.

Data is stored on [Github](https://github.com/fikriazh/fikri) repo and connected to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) as hugo deployment and processing to static site and free sub-domain [fikri.pages.dev](/) from Cloudflare Pages as it's offer free HTTPS access. This site also connected to cloud CMS using [Forestry.io](https://forestry.io/).

My workflow in this site : Input writing on local cloned repo, edit my markdown content file with VS Code editor and push the commit directly to github. Another workflow is through smartphone with cloud forestry.io cloud CMS. I use this methode usually when in remote and unable to access notebook. Forestry.io will monitor the changes and automatically push to github. I usually write and arrange the content on smartphone notes first then paste to forestry.io CMS.

If github repo detect any commit and push either from local cloned repo or from forestry.io, it will trigger deployment on Cloudflare Pages server and create static site to be served to fikri.pages.dev domain. This simplistic and automatic workflow makes me focus on content-making rather than thinking the tech bla bla bla behind the scene.

I use tiny netbook with Zorin operation system (lightweight linux OS based form Ubuntu). It's comfort enough to handle my writing, both in blog making and professional reporting. As a remote engineer, it is kind of a wise to carry minimal setup in the midst of forest.

## Epilog

Thanks for so far reading until this end section, hope you get much of knowledge and information from my own perspective. Keep finding the truth, the system works behind this dimensional barrier. As we will keep evolving to *Homo Deus*, the human with 100% DNA function as our creator Enki Anunnaki imprint to us.
