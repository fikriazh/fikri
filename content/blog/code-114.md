One side effect caused by spiritual awakening is the increasing of our consciousness level into higher perception and comprehension to higher realm. We have wider perspective, kinda bird eye view, where we can see this universe as whole as it is. Another sign is a synchronization where we will receive so many code through certain pattern number. Everyone will have different code number. In my case, the code is 114 or 411.

Why so this number keep showing?

It began since the first awakening moment, 3 years ago. At first, I always see certain number in any occasion, time and place. First code is 12:34, a code that signify that our energy is "being leveling up", as it literally 1 2 3 4, increasing number pattern. This code is showing for only 2 weeks, in my room digital clock. After code 12:34, another code that follows is 11:11. This code is signify "the gate to the higher realm", as it's form is like gate. This code is also last for around a weeks. After that, the ultimate code is showing up, 114 or 411.

## Evidence of 114
Following is some picture taken by me with pattern code 114 :

> Note : The pictures above are some examples that I can take photos of, while there are many more that I didn't have time to capture.

Why there are so many same pattern shows? What is core meaning of that code? How to decipher that code? Those are current question that still haunt me. As for now, I can only answer that that code is a clue from the ruler of higher realm.
