Concept of simulation is a <abbr title="a framework  of how the universe system works.">cosmological</abbr> concept from western. It models a programmer that create, program and play his own game. To simplify this concept, just imagine, a program called Unreal Engine, where you can compose your game. In that software you can design all of the working system, connecting nodes of all aspect. If you finish designing your game, then you can play it directly.

In that game, you are the creator, God. You are the ruler in that game. You create the environment and ecological balance, and how all nodes is connected. You create the creature you want, the plant you want, it's up to you.

One thing that make biggest difference is that you as the creator are completely different with your creator. The creator is only a software, unreal physical being. But it will be different when you use the help of one tools called <abbr title="Virtual Reality">VR</abbr>. It is attached to your head and your view is narrowed only to the screen inside VR. You feel new reality inside this virtual. Current VR technologies is limited only to feed to eyes and ears, so called visual and audio.

But how if you can connect all of six senses to the game? Or at least audio, visual and neurology (senses). So your audio, visual and sensing syncronizes to system. For example, in fighting scene, you see an epic war scene with triumph and yelled sound, and you can feel that stabing from sword. All three experiences is only simulated, but you feel it is real.

Such parable is easy way to describe this universe. The universe is a game, huge game as a playground, a place were all of the player play the game, game of life. This universe is simulation world game. We as the character is in physical dimension and the player is in mental dimension. We are being played by the player.

Our physical body is same as VR tools for the player in higher dimension. Our body needs to be charged every day a.k.a sleeping. When the body is being charged, the player must log out from the game, this is why our consciousness is lost when we are sleeping on every night. Our consciousness is a projection from the consciousness of the player itself.

Our body has complex technologies to simulate all aspect of life. The player is locked in the pysical body, this is why smallest object is called as "cell" (as prison cell, locked). Cell is place where player is locked to our physical bodies and locked to physical dimension.

> When our body is damaged too much, it will break the connection to the server of the game. If such happens, the game is over, the player finished his current game, we call it as "die".

So, what's happen next?

The player will wake up and continue life in fourth dimension, called as spiritual realm, back to true life, not simulation anymore. The player will gain certain score based on his achievement on last life game on physical world. This score will be accumulated from one game to another game. Current score also will determine his next life on simulation. Due to the harshness and how deep the player bound to the last game, the player will go to the <abbr title="It is religiously called as Hell">"spiritual hospital"</abbr> to heal all of painful experience. After fully being healed, the player is given certain options. Thus are either go to library of life or direclty go to next simulation game (we called as reincarnation).
