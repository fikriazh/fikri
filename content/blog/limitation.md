We first must define the different between physical dan soul dimension. Physical dimension is a place for our simulation game. This dimension is real for us in physical dimension, but only a simulation playground for the player in soul dimension. The soul dimension itself is a real dimension of us, the true player. Because our condition now is in simulation world, so we must degrade and lower our power to fit physical world law of nature. Both of physical and soul dimension are living together in ourself.

Let's think, we are always able to imagine unlimited ideas, huge concept of this world. We always want to fix this trouble world, and we have a proof of concept on how to achieve that crazy ideas to make perfect world. In the end, that whole ideas are in our soul, inside our cell body. Cell is like a prison for the soul. In the other world, our body is merely a prison where our limitless soul is limited by our weakened body. 

This physical world is being downgraded exponentially in any aspect of side. This is meant as a challenge to the soul, to measure it's power and skill of life in a limited simulation world. A powerful and limitless soul choose to live in simulation as a learning progress.

To achieve full and whole experience of this life, a soul have to break apart complex problem in many life in simulation world on earth (or maybe another livable planet, if any ðŸ¤”).

Since each of soul has very own unique life path, so the main life theme is still same but physical life is different on every life. One scenario of physical life have one certain main theme to fill the unfilled experience for the soul. As the progress continuos, the soul must live in thousand life incarnation until achieve perfect soul with full purity.

> It is easy to guess what the main theme our life is. Just look deeper at ourself, what problem that always repeats in loop. It maybe a money, love, gender identity, etc. We are challenged to overcome that hard aspect as that is our least experienced aspect. We are forced by nature.

So how if we fail to overcome this challenge of life? Simply just reincarnating more and more, until the creator of all decide to end his game and maybe make another game of other universe.
