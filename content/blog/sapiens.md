*Sapiens*, a mammals species, our species, us, mankind, isn't an evolution from apes, but rather an instant experiment combined from Anunnaki and *Homo erectus*, most modern mammals in the beginning time. This creature is supposedly created to be a slave as a gold miner. It begins the concept of ruler-ruled and why gold is such a precious commodity.

The story begins when earth is inhabited by *homo erectus* as top level ruler. They dominate earth with hunting, gathering and early farming skill. But yet no intelligent like sapiens. They are a pure product of evolution of mammals species, so called apes family. They conduct simple technology to survive on harsh nature in prior time.

The creator of all then change the destiny of our planet earth. There are several creature comes down from the sky with highly modern technologies, called Anunnaki. They are also a mammals species but developed in another habitable planet beside earth, Nibiru. Simply, we can mention them as 1M years evolution ahead than us, sapiens. But why they are coming down to earth?

Short story, in their native planet, Nibiru, the ozone layer is thinning down and they need kind of material to enclose that hole. They do research and find that gold is best material to close the hole. But there is no enough gold to be mined. So they decide to do space exploration to find a planet with abundant gold. Nibiru is a planet that still in our solar system with sun as the center. But Nibiru have weird orbit shape, kind of comet oval shape where one time will get near to the sun and far away in other time with 3600 years revolution cycle.

Anunnaki arrives in planet earth on place now called as Iraq-Iran land (Mesopotamia) and build a headquarters. They explore entire earth finding for gold deposit and found massive gold deposit on southern africa. So they begin build sub-headquarter on southern-africa and starting mining gold. At first, the miner is from Nibiru, kind of lower class Anunnaki.

While mining the gold, an Anunnaki scientist also build a laboratory to do research the creature on southern africa. The scientist found a unique creature *'homo erectus'*, an ape species with highest evolution phase on earth at that time. Erectus is an ape species that have been able to walk with two legs rather four legs like another apes species.

As time goes by, the mining is still progressing, the anunnaki miner is protesting because of tiredness. They then stop the mining operation and want to go home to planet Nibiru. This is caused beside of tiredness, but also because they also far away from families, their loved one. They want to be changed by another group of miners. The anunnaki meets together to discuss this problem.

Shortly, the scientist suggest to use the creature (homo erectus) to change the worker. But another problem occurs, as homo erectus hasn't have yet enough intelligent to be command to work as a gold miner. The scientist then asked how if we manipulate this creature and combine with our DNA to make another more intelligent creature. So we can evolve this limited creature into more functional with limited intelligent enough to mine the gold but not as highly intelligent as the anunnaki.

This suggestion is rejected at first, because the think that the right for creating creature is only for The Creator of All and we have no right to take part in such creation. The scientist is finally able to convince the forum and genetics engineering is begun with main requirement is the scientist only change basic genetic that allow the creature with only limited intelligent enough to dig the mining.

> Homo sapiens = homo erectus + anunnaki

As time goes by, the scientist do the research and genetic engineering into homo erectus by taking the cell DNA and combine into female anunnaki womb. After hundred trials and error, finally they success to born a combined species, called *homo sapiens*, and this first male creature is called adamu. With further modification, they also success to create female species. Shortly, this pair of sapiens succeeded in procreating and the mining progress can be continued.

I will end this part here, as the beginning of our species, homo sapiens. This part is emphasize on the creation process and further developments of our species will be served on another post.
