Is this universe mere abstract of anything without any rule from higher entities? Or does it have set of ruler (heavenly government?) that orchestrate all aspect of our physical dimension on earth?

Since I learn hypnotherapy and deal with subconscious realm, I start realizing that our human body have several aspect. Physical aspect consist of the system such as blood circulation, breathing system, etc., in computer technology is called as hardware. Another aspect is "software-like" system that program all of the hardware, mainly placed on our brain. In this topic, I will focus on software system of our human body.

This software system will be called "consciousness". Shortly, our consciousness has capability and responsibility to control and command the entire system of our physical body. Analogically same as hardware - software - brainware. Hardware is our physical functional organ, software is our consciousness or brain system, and while brainware is such a bridge from our third physical realm to spiritual realm, where "the player" of our body (soul, spirit) connect and synchronize to fully simulating different realm.

Connectedness between two realm is called "synchronization", a continuos streaming process from universal server to send and receive such data. With average low consciousness level in current population of *homo sapiens*, it's too hard to comprehend this concept, isn't it? As time (incarnation) and our level of consciousness is progressively increasing, we will gradually feel this synchronizing energies in various way.

One pattern that always shows to me is code 114. This phenomena is one example of synchronization from higher realm to our physical realm. More details about code 114 can be read at [Code 114](/blog/114).
