A substantial question among us all. Have all been written? Predestined? What is direct impact of that predestined concept? Is that really important to be thought?

Answering this concept is kind of something is not important at all. It is because even either this life is predestined or free-will, basically we still wont know absolute truth behind this curtain of destiny. This concept is only to be used as material for thinking of our existence. We still have to face the challenge given by our own choices before taking current life.

## Predestined

Concept of predestined life is coming from the creator itself. In the beginning, the creator of all is designing the concept of the game. He makes all aspect of framework system as a foundation so this universe can be played. Then He makes all of the character that can be played altogether with their own scenario. So from this point of view, the creator wanna make a game that can't be changed of it's scenario. The player only will sit, live and feel of predestined scenario. The player has no reason to choose their life path.

This concept is such an easy level of game. But this concept is useful in making basic characteristic for soul (the player) as player have no choice at all. Because the game forces the soul to live certain scenario, i.e. this concept is like molding-casting concept. For consequent life incarnation, the soul will get their character to be played with free will in the next incarnation.

This is why in many religious concept, we're told about the future and destiny of this life in very detail explanation. It may be a result of a scenario where the creator of all is going to spoil His creation and all scenario to the chosen human, as we called as "The Messenger or The Prophet". As literally said, The Messenger is a human with life scenario contains direct news from the creator.
 
Next question is arising. Why the creator of all spoil His creation scenario? Wont it make the system to break apart? Simple answer, even the creator is spoiling the scenario to human, human itself wont realize the big scenario at all. For example, let say the creator tells about the concept of afterlife (heaven and hell concept), we can only visualize and imagine this concept, but don't know at all about the truth of those. So, spoiling the scenario is nothing for the creator.

## Un-Destined (Free-Will)

This free will concept is only felt by our point of view as a player in physical dimension. We think that we can take control of our life by our own power. But we don't yet realize that something that we call it as free will is also still part of bigger scenario beyond our comprehension. We perceive what our brain can receive. But our soul can reach beyond what our brain can think.

> The creator of all creates Anunnaki, then anunnaki create homo sapiens. Hierarchically, we have 2 creator, the creator of our species and the creator of all universe. 

At the end, everything is a product of the creator's scenario. Even the anunnaki itself is still under the rule of the creator of all.

It is still a hard proof of thinking about this concept because our society is still tied by religious concept left by anunnaki itself. But for those who has reach enlightenment, dare to go beyond limited religious concept, they will get reward, a liberation way of thinking with broader perspective.

Summarily, either destined or free-will concept, it doesn't even matter at all. Just live your scenario with all of your knowledge. Always upgrade your level of consciousness and expand your perspective of this universe.
