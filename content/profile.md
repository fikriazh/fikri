Hi, I'm [Tobi](/profile/), a hands-on digitalisation expert in Munich---an engineer at heart with a business value-driven mindset.

## Experience

At [Plan.Net Connect][Plan.Net], I work at the intersection of online marketing, business intelligence and marketing automation to enable companies to deliver dependable, personalised and profitable digital experiences to their customers. I build and lead a team of experts to elevate digital marketing to the next level by implementing customer-centricity in all marketing activities. Using state of the art marketing technology like Customer Data Platforms, I establish data-driven operation processes to optimise marketing activities with incremental learning. I consult customers on all project phases‚Äîfrom analysing business requirements to implementing technical solutions. Apr 2021 - Present

At [Commanders Act], I consulted and enabled companies to optimise their digital marketing with the Commanders Act product toolchain (Tag Management System, Customer Data Platform and Consent Management Platform). Furthermore, I was an integral part of the DACH B2B pre-sales consulting team that won pitches of leading international brands. I developed innovative concepts for the evolution of the Commanders Act platform and supported the production team as an internal SCRUM product owner. Jan 2018 - Mar 2021

At [POSSIBLE] (now Wunderman Thompson), I provided consulting and technical project management for agile digitalisation projects across a broad range of industries. I led digital transformation projects with international SCRUM teams by developing POCs, websites, apps and digital products. Additionally, I led a team that provided mobile app store operations as a service for enterprise customers. May 2014 - Dec 2017

I started to work on hands-on technical and creative freelance projects during my studies. I worked on diverse creative projects (ranging from sound recording and sound design for online conferences to producing advertising films) until I found my passion in digitalisation. Now I implement websites for small to medium-sized businesses as a part-time freelancer. This provides me with opportunities to broaden my practical technical skills and to try out new cutting edge technologies.

## Skills

I am an expert at **engineering** digital solutions. I analyse user requirements, sketch out technical architectures, develop websites and prototypes from scratch, and write glue code between existing tech solutions.

As an Industrial Engineer and certified SCRUM Project Manager---I know how to translate technology into business and business into technology. Digitalisation does not work without proper **communication**.

**Digital Marketing** combines the best of technology, communication, business, and creativity. Moreover, it drives the current digital transformation process of companies. Digital Marketing is a perfect fit for my multidisciplinary skillset that I picked up along with my work in digital agencies, media production and mar-tech companies.

## Technology

Web development is a technology branch that develops fast and brings up new frameworks and programming languages every day. To keep up with this I focus on training the fundamental web programming languages **HTML, CSS and JavaScript**---for new technologies I always try to check the effort to learn it in relation to the value it provides.

Every programmer has his go-to general-purpose programming language to automate everyday tasks. I chose **[Node]**, a very obvious addition to my skill set as it relies on JavaScript---the same programming language that is used for websites. I also use Node for writing servers and APIs and use it for data science and visualisation tasks. **[Deno]** is an evolution of Node by its creator [Ryan Dahl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Dahl). Deno tries to solve some design issues of Node while providing optimised DX. Thus I started to migrate to Deno.

## Languages

Based on many years of working experience in international companies I am fluent in business level **English** for tech and marketing related topics. **German** is my mother tongue.

## Recreation

My spare time activity changed throughout 2020. Most important I became a dad üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß, and then there also was this thing called COVID ü¶†... Currently, I like going on very slow walks (that is how it is with small kids) üå≤ or cycling through forests around Munich üö≤. I enjoy practising the low [Irish tin whistle](/tunes/) üé∂ taking online classes and listening to audiobooks üéß. As restaurants changed I started eating out in beer gardens and grabbing takeaway food ü•ô to eat in one of Munich's nice parks üèû. I enjoy playing Dungeons & Dragons üêâ both as a player and dungeon master. It is a great way to have some social fun during these crazy times as it's easy to play offline and online and is a great starter to talk with friends. Computer work can be quite draining. I thus do some basic callisthenics üí™, yoga ü•ã and zazen üßò to recover. My vacations üèñ are now happening in the near vicinity of Bavaria---targeting some nice mountain lakes (long trips are difficult with small kids and we never know when COVID lockdown strikes again).
